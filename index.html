<h1>Active case relation to population density</h1>

    <h2>India</h2>
    <p> Covid-19 in India took a heavy toll on the population and the wellbeing for a long period of time due to a number of factors
        such as population density, vaccinations, ICU beds, etc. This map shows the growth of covid per state in the form of heatmap
        using month scale on the axis below

    <h2>The effect of lockdown on the death count</h2>

        lockdowns on the spread. </p>

    <h2>The effect of ICU beds on deaths</h2>
    <p>India underwent a serious shortage of oxygen tanks and ICU beds as critical cases were on rise as compared to non critical
        cases which did not need serious attention. This led to a lot of deaths and concern for the future. This line graph shows the
        surge of deaths which may directly be a result of the shortage.
